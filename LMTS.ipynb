feather boa the pronouncement left cruz visibly nervous and no doubt has his pr team doing some immediate damage limitation among cruz s evangelical basethe cruz family was on stage with anderson cooper on wednesday night and the whole scene is a perfect reminder of the phrase never work with children or animals this week s town halls have placed their focus on the personal lives of the

further in an attempt to up his credentials as a folksy involved dad   telling them that he often plays dress up with his daughters she got to dress up daddy in a pink boa and these like big goofylooking underwear he grinned at his daughter carolinehowever caroline then chimed in with a revelation that left the senator briefly stumped and inaudible it was on a videotape the whole time  she said as millions of americans watched the scene unfold from home  and that was a class video that they re sending out to all the parents cruz could only muster a brief  oh oh  while heidi

\"washington reuters  a top us regulator for wall street took the unusual step on monday of directly asking president donald trump to veto a resolution that allows financial companies to block customers from banding together to sue a request likely to be ignored the consumer financial protection bureau an independent regulator headed by democrat richard cordray finalized a rule in july barring banks creditcard issuers and other financial companies from requiring customers to give up their rights to join group lawsuits known as class actions and only take potential disputes to closeddoor arbitration congress recently voted to kill the rule in a special resolution that trump a republican is expected to sign into law soon \\u201cyou alone now have the power to safeguard people\\u2019s ability to take action together and go to court when they are wronged\\u201d cordray expected to resign soon to run for ohio governor wrote to trump white house officials were not immediately available to comment on the letter in class actions individuals with the same complaint band together to lower lawsuit costs trump has not vetoed any legislation since taking office in january but he has frequently criticized both cordray appointed by former democratic president barack obama and the cfpb established after the financial crisis to protect individuals against predatory lending cordray wrote he had never met or spoken to trump but that \\u201cmany have told me your mind is made up\\u201d about the resolution shortly after the senate passed the resolution last tuesday the white house released a statement saying the cfpb rule would give consumers fewer options to resolve disputes quickly and efficiently and would primarily enrich trial lawyers the administration has also said the cfpb used faulty research to write the rule the cfpb says its fiveyear study into mandatory arbitration was thorough and its rule based on sound data rule supporters say arbitration is stacked in favor of companies which hire the mediators and that the right to trial is enshrined in the constitution on friday military veterans also asked for a veto regulators almost never make personal pleas for vetoes let alone release their requests publicly  cordray has a strained relationship with republicans who say he has too much power because he both writes and enforces rules and can only be fired \\u201cfor cause\\u201d a strict standard nearly impossible to meet trump has gone as far as arguing in court filings that the cfpb is unconstitutional and he should have the power
